## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation & Setup
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Dependencies:** None

#### Sub-steps:
- [ ] Set up development environment (Node.js, pnpm, Vite, Convex CLI)
- [ ] Initialize project structure (frontend, backend, /Docs)
- [ ] Configure build tools and CI/CD (GitHub Actions, linting, formatting)
- [ ] Set up Convex database and define initial schema
- [ ] Integrate better-auth for authentication and role management

### Stage 2: Core Features
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion

#### Sub-steps:
- [ ] Implement secure authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in, password reset)
- [ ] Implement multi-tenancy and district data isolation
- [ ] Build document upload, listing, and deletion (with status tracking)
- [ ] Develop real-time AI chat interface (context selection, chat history)
- [ ] Enable actionable content generation (lesson plans, assessments)
- [ ] Set up role-based access control for all features
- [ ] Integrate Polar for subscription management and gating

### Stage 3: Advanced Features
**Duration:** 3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 2 completion

#### Sub-steps:
- [ ] Build Coach's knowledge base interface and integration
- [ ] Implement analytics dashboard (aggregated, anonymized data)
- [ ] Add export functionality for AI-generated content (.docx, .pdf)
- [ ] Implement quality assurance/feedback for AI outputs
